# Crime in North Carolina
## An Econometric Analysis of Data from 1987

#### [Greg Tozzi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregorytozzi/) | December, 2019

*This is my final project from the [statistics for data science](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/203) course that I took as part of the UC Berkeley School of Information's [Master of Information and Data Science](https://datascience.berkeley.edu) program.  This project was intended as a group project, but I completed it individually due to time constraints related to my work.  The intent of the project was to present an econometric analysis of crime data from North Carolina from the standpoint of a political consultant hired by an unspecified party in the state.  In this report, I present a parsimonious linear model of crime in North Carolina and assess its implications for the notional party.*
